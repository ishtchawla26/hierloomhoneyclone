                <h3>Eucalyptus marginata</h3>
                <p>
                  Recognised by its Aboriginal name, Jarrah trees exhibit a
                  remarkably slow growth rate and are exclusive to the native
                  forests in the southwestern region of Western Australia. The
                  venerable Jarrah trees, aged over 300 years, thrive on
                  protected land in Lane Poole and produce an exceptionally pure
                  honey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  requires robust and healthy bee colonies, as the fragile
                  nectar flow can be instantly halted by a mere heatwave due to
                  the limited amounts in the blossoms. This precarious nature of
                  the flowering season makes Jarrah honey an exceptionally rare
                  treasure - some of the rarest honey in the world

                <h3>Tasting Notes</h3>
                <p>
                  The taste experience of Old-Growth Jarrah Honey is a
                  harmonious blend of robustness and smoothness, gradually
                  transitioning into luscious caramel undertones. This honey
                  showcases an exceptionally smooth and caramel-like flavour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Distinguished by a profound and intricate fusion of malty,
                  minerally, floral, and tangy notes, it offers a unique palate
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mouthfeel is distinctive, characterised by a glassy and
                  smooth texture, yet with a sharpness that emerges at the back
                  of your palate, providing an intriguing contrast to the
                  honey's inherent sweetness.
                </p>
                <h5>Food pairing</h5>
                <p>
                  Jarrah honey's thicker texture makes it an ideal match when
                  paired with either a creamy blue cheese or a nutty Comt√© on a
                  cheeseboard. Its profound, caramel-like undertones beautifully
                  complement the creamy and savoury notes found in the cheeses,
                  achieving a delightful balance of sweet and savoury flavours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Raw and unheated Jarrah remains clear, smooth, and rarely
                  crystallises - a very rare feature in natural honey.
